<h1>Feminist of today as reflection of past</h1>
    <h2>Liv Stromquist : Who isshe ?</h2>
    <p>Liv Strömquist is a Swedish comic book writer and journalist, born the 3 February 1978, who has appeared on
        Swedish Radio since 2005. At the age of 17, she attended a conference on feminism that changed her vision of things and society.
        She then began to draw comic strips like “The Origin of the World”</p>
    <img src="public/img/Prince Charles 1.svg" height="130px" width="130px" align="left" alt="Les secrets du Prince Charles" />
    <p>“The Feelings of Prince Charles”, in the latter, she is interested in marriage, and wonders what marriage represents? She analyzes the
        relationships of marriage with a strong feminist side!</p>
    <p>She says it herself: “I went to a feminist conference when I
        was 17 and when I came home I read all the feminist literature. ”
        And since then, she has decided to contribute to the edifice by freeing the floor on subjects that may sometimes be
        taboo, daring to show what others would not dare to show! She is extremely popular in Sweden thanks to her
        comics and her voice is a voice that counts, helping the women’s movement.
        It is a symbol of freedom, a symbol of the ideas of a generation crying out for freedom and equality!</p>
    <h2>Kerstin Hesselgren : who wasshe ?</h2>
    <p>Kerstin Hesselgren born the 14 January 1872 and died the 19 August 196 was a Swedish politician woman . She
        was candidate in the first parliamentary elections open to women and was the first woman elected to the upper
        house of the Swedish Parliament (Riksdag). She held this position until 1944, a 23-year political career, under the
        banner of the People’s Party, to which she joined in 1934. She was also president of the Swedish National Women’s
        Association from 1921 to 1930, and later became president of the Swedish Left Women’s Association until 1946.</p>
    <img src="public/img/Hesselgren 1.svg" height="130px" width="130px" align="right" alt="Kerstin Hesselgren" />
    <p>Through her actions and her career, first woman elected to the highest parliament in Sweden, then president of a
        feminist and political association, she liberated speech and opinion on a taboo subject in 1900: women and politics,
        women’s place in politics, women’s right to vote, etc.</p>
    <p>Kerstin Hesselgren had some “networks”, “connections” from
        his former work, which favoured his election. She previously worked in the labour inspectorate. Her job was to
        improve the conditions of working women. In particular, she attended the Congress of the International Labour Organization in Washington.
        As a woman and a participant, she was a precursor to the presence of women at these
international congresses. A few years later, she was the first woman to represent a country (Sweden) at League of
Nations meetings.</p>
    <h2>What isthe connexion between her?</h2>
    <p>Liv Stromquist and Kerstin Hesselgren are two women from different eras but represent continuity, past, present
        and future. Both defend their cause at 2 different period, and also in a different context: Kerstin Hesselgren
        between the 2 World Wars and Liv Stromquist in the 21st century, but their ideas are the same: affirm a little more
        the place and role of women in society as equal to men.</p>
